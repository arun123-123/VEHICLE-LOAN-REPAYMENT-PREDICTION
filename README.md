EXPLANATION ABOUT PROJECT:

  Financial institutions incur significant lossess due to the default of vehicle loan underwriting and increased vehicle loan underwriting and increased vehicle loan rejection rates.  The need for a better credeit risk scoring model is also raised by these institutions.

This warrants a study to estimate determinants of vehicle loan default. A financial institution has hired you to accuratelu predict the probability of loan/borrower defaulting on a vehicle loan in the first EMI(Equated Monthly Instalment) on the due date.  Following information regarding the loan and loanee are provided  in the dataset.

Loanee information(Demographic data like age, income, identity proof etc). Loan information (Disbursal details, amount, EMI, loan to value ration etc..  Bureau data and history (Bureau score, number of active accounts, the status of other loans, credit history etc).  Doing so will ensure that clients capable of repayment are not rejected and important determinants can be identified which can be further used for minimising the default rates.
